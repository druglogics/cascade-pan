# cascade-pan

*pan* => **P**erturb **A**ll **N**odes (every node in the model is inhibited by a different drug)

# Info

We used the [druglogics-synergy](https://github.com/druglogics/druglogics-synergy) pipeline executor module (version `1.2.0`) on the CASCADE 1.0 and 2.0 topologies, to perform a full drug pairs response analysis.
For each network topology, we used a drug panel that had **one drug per every node** in the corresponding signaling networks and tested every drug combination up to order 2 (so all possible drug pairs).

# Results

For the results with all drug pairs, see the [cascade1.0_pan](https://github.com/druglogics/cascade-pan/tree/main/cascade1.0_pan) and [cascade2.0_pan](https://github.com/druglogics/cascade-pan/tree/main/cascade2.0_pan) directories respectively.
