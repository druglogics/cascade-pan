# cascade-pan

We used the [druglogics-synergy](https://github.com/druglogics/druglogics-synergy) pipeline executor module (version `1.2.0`) on the CASCADE 1.0 and 2.0 topologies, to perform a full drug response analysis on a drug panel that has one drug per every node in the correspoding signaling network.

Currently, every drug combination up to order 2 (drug pairs) has been tested.
See respective results in the `cascade1.0_pan` and `cascade2.0_pan` directories.
